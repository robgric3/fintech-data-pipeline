# Financial Data ETL Pipeline - Airflow Service Dockerfile
# =============================================================================
# This Dockerfile extends the official Airflow image to include additional
# dependencies required for financial data processing and ETL tasks.
# =============================================================================

# Use specific Airflow version (not 'latest') for stability and reproducibility
# Using Python 3.10 for consistency with other services
FROM apache/airflow:2.5.1-python3.10

# Switch to root user temporarily to install system dependencies
# This is necessary for some Python packages that require compilation
USER root

# Install system dependencies required by Python packages
# Use --no-install-recommends to minimize image size
# Group commands and clean up in the same layer to reduce image size
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    # build-essential: Provides compilation tools needed for some Python packages
    build-essential \
    # Clean up to reduce image size
    && apt-get clean \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Switch back to airflow user for security
# Running as non-root is a Docker best practice
USER airflow

# Copy requirements file for additional Python packages
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install additional Python packages needed for ETL tasks
# --no-cache-dir reduces the image size by not storing the pip cache
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# No CMD needed as the base image already has appropriate entrypoints
# The command will be specified in docker-compose.yml (webserver or scheduler)
